I'd take the fall
I got you covered when
there's no one at all
Ah yea and
I'd stay through the night
When you got demons tryna
break through the walls
There ain't no, no kind of line
That i wouldn't cross
if u need me to
You're out here
searching for signs
So I think it's finally time
thatchu knew
Nobody got you the way I do
Whatever demons u
fightin through
When you need
somebody to turn to
Nobody got you the way I do
Nobody - nobody - nobody
Nobody got you the way I do
Nobody - nobody - nobody
Nobody got you the way I do
When you go dark and the nights
get so cold
I'll be on my way to you
You know I ain't tryna
lose you oh no
If you're in hell
I'll go there too
There ain't no, no kind of line
That i wouldn't cross
if u need me to
You're out here
searching for signs
So I think it's finally time
thatchu knew
Nobody got you the way I do
Whatever demons u
fightin through
When you need
somebody to turn to
Nobody got you the way I do
Nobody - nobody - nobody
Nobody got you the way I do
Nobody - nobody - nobody
Nobody got you the way I do
Nobody got you the way I do
Nobody - nobody - nobody
Nobody got you the way I do
Nobody - nobody - nobody
Nobody got you the way I do
Nobody - nobody - nobody
Nobody got you the way I do
